🔄 What is Inverse ARP (InARP)?

Inverse ARP is used to discover Layer 3 (IP) addresses of remote devices when you already know the Layer 2 address (like a Frame Relay DLCI or ATM VPI/VCI).

📘 In Simple Terms:
Protocol	You Know	You Want to Find
ARP	IP Address	MAC Address
RARP	MAC Address	IP Address
Inverse ARP	Layer 2 Address (e.g. DLCI)	IP Address
📍 Where is InARP Used?

Mainly in non-Ethernet Layer 2 technologies like:

Frame Relay

ATM

X.25

These are non-broadcast multi-access networks — meaning they don't support ARP broadcasts like Ethernet does.

🧪 Example Scenario (Frame Relay):

Router A is connected to Router B over Frame Relay using DLCI 102.

Router A receives Layer 2 info (DLCI 102) but doesn’t yet know B’s IP address.

Router A sends an Inverse ARP request over DLCI 102:

"Hey, what’s your IP address?"

Router B replies with its IP address.

Router A can now route IP traffic to Router B over that DLCI.

✅ Key Features of InARP:

Defined in RFC 2390

Used in non-broadcast environments

Enables dynamic mapping of Layer 2 to Layer 3

Often used in point-to-point WAN links

❌ Why It's Rare Now:

Ethernet-based networks dominate, and Ethernet uses regular ARP

Technologies like Frame Relay and ATM are largely obsolete

Modern networks use DHCP, static IPs, or routing protocols to learn neighbors

Protocol	Use Case	Common Today?
ARP	IP ➜ MAC	✅ Yes
RARP	MAC ➜ IP	❌ No (obsolete)
InARP	DLCI ➜ IP	❌ Rare (used in legacy WAN tech)
