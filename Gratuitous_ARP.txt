🔄 What is Gratuitous ARP (GARP)?

Gratuitous ARP is when a device sends an ARP request (or reply) for its own IP address, without being asked.

In simple terms:
“This is my IP address and MAC — everyone, update your ARP tables!”

📘 Use Case Summary:
Purpose	Description
🟢 IP conflict detection	A device sends GARP to see if anyone else responds (which would mean a duplicate IP)
🔄 Update ARP caches	Used to refresh or update other devices’ ARP tables after changes (like MAC address changes)
📡 Announce IP-MAC binding	When a device comes online or moves to a new port, it announces its IP/MAC
🧠 Used by Virtual IPs / HA	VRRP, HSRP, and clustering systems use it to shift IP ownership to a new device
🧪 How GARP Works:

Let’s say a device has:

IP: 192.168.1.10

MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

It sends:

ARP Request:
Who has 192.168.1.10? Tell 192.168.1.10
(Sent as a broadcast)


Since it's asking about its own IP, no reply is expected — it's just informing the network.

⚠️ Important Behavior:

Some devices send GARP as a reply instead of a request (less common)

GARP is not a standard part of the ARP process — it's an extension

It’s triggered when:

A system boots

An interface comes up

IP or MAC changes

Failover happens in high availability setups

🧰 Common GARP Use Cases:
✅ 1. IP Conflict Detection

Before using an IP, send GARP.

If someone replies: “Hey, that’s my IP!” — then there's a conflict.

✅ 2. High Availability (HA) and VRRP/HSRP

When Router B takes over a VIP, it sends GARP so hosts know:

“The IP is now at a different MAC.”

✅ 3. NIC Failover or MAC Change

GARP ensures switches and ARP caches update to the new MAC

🔐 Security Note:

GARP can be abused for ARP spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks

Network security tools can monitor for excessive or unexpected GARP traffic
