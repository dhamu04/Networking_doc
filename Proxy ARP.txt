Proxy ARP:

10.1.1.2/8 and 10.1.2.1/24 is in same network?
ChatGPT said:

Let's analyze this carefully:

📌 IPs and Subnet Masks:

Device A: 10.1.1.2/8
→ Subnet: 10.0.0.0/8
→ Range: 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254

Device B: 10.1.2.1/24
→ Subnet: 10.1.2.0/24
→ Range: 10.1.2.1 to 10.1.2.254

🧠 Are they in the same network?

From Device A’s view (/8):

10.1.2.1 is within 10.0.0.0/8 ✅
→ A thinks B is on the same network

From Device B’s view (/24):

10.1.1.2 is NOT in 10.1.2.0/24 ❌
→ B thinks A is on a different network

⚠️ Result: They are NOT in the same network

They have mismatched subnet masks.

So they don’t both agree on whether they are in the same network.

This can cause communication issues unless:

There’s a router/gateway involved, or

A Proxy ARP setup helps bridge them.

✅ Final Answer:

❌ No, 10.1.1.2/8 and 10.1.2.1/24 are not in the same network
because only one device (with /8) sees them as being in the same subnet.

Let me know if you'd like to see how they'd communicate in a real packet capture or routing scenario.

You said:
if we configured default gateway means proxy Arp not required?
ChatGPT said:

Great question — this gets to the heart of how hosts communicate across subnets, and when Proxy ARP is or isn’t needed.

✅ Short Answer:

If a correct default gateway is configured, Proxy ARP is usually not needed.

📘 Why?

Let’s say:

Host A: 10.1.1.2/24, GW: 10.1.1.1

Host B: 10.1.2.1/24, GW: 10.1.2.254

These are on different subnets:

A = 10.1.1.0/24

B = 10.1.2.0/24

📥 What Happens with a Default Gateway?

Host A wants to send to 10.1.2.1

A checks: Is 10.1.2.1 in my subnet (10.1.1.0/24)?
→ No

A sends the packet to its default gateway

The router forwards it to B's network

No Proxy ARP needed — just standard Layer 3 routing.

🔁 What Happens With Proxy ARP (and no gateway)?

If:

Host A has no default gateway

A thinks 10.1.2.1 is remote (correctly)

But it doesn’t know how to reach it

A sends an ARP request for 10.1.2.1 anyway

➡️ If a router has Proxy ARP enabled, it replies with its own MAC address, pretending to be 10.1.2.1.

So A sends the packet to the router, which then forwards it — mimicking gateway behavior.

✅ Summary: When Proxy ARP is not needed
Case	Is Proxy ARP Needed?	Why?
✅ Host has correct default gateway	❌ No	Router handles routing
❌ Host has no gateway	✅ Yes	Proxy ARP fakes local presence
❌ Mismatched subnetting	✅ Maybe	Proxy ARP bridges gap
✅ Both in same subnet	❌ No	ARP works directly
🔐 Best Practice:

Always configure a proper default gateway instead of relying on Proxy ARP — it’s more predictable, scalable, and secure.
