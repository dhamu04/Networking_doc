🔄 What is Reverse ARP (RARP)?

RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol, and it's the opposite of ARP.

🧠 ARP vs. RARP:
Protocol	Used for	Input	Output
ARP	Find MAC address from IP	IP address	MAC address
RARP	Find IP address from MAC	MAC address	IP address
📦 When is RARP used?

RARP was used in the early days of networking for devices that:

Knew their MAC address

But didn't know their IP address

And couldn't store a local configuration (like diskless workstations)

Such a device would broadcast a RARP request, saying:

"Hey, here's my MAC address. Can anyone tell me what IP address I should use?"

A RARP server would respond with the correct IP address.

🛑 Why RARP is Obsolete Now:

RARP had several limitations:

Could only provide an IP address, not other info like gateway, DNS, subnet mask

Required a dedicated RARP server

Worked only over Layer 2

✅ Replaced by:

BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – the modern standard

DHCP is far more flexible: it can assign IP, subnet, gateway, DNS, lease time, and more.

🔧 Summary:
Feature	RARP	DHCP
Direction	MAC ➜ IP	No IP ➜ Full config
Broadcast?	Yes	Yes
Needs server?	Yes (RARP server)	Yes (DHCP server)
Still used?	❌ Obsolete	✅ Standard today
🧪 Fun fact:

Some embedded devices or legacy UNIX systems still had RARP support back in the day, but you won’t see it in modern networks.
